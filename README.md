Welcome to an intro portfolio of myself: Grant Copeland.

Please download all files and start by opening the 'index-home.html' file. From there you can:
- Navigate through to other pages by clicking on the buttons on the home page. There are four pages: Home, About Me, Past Works of Note, and Contact
- The 'About Me' and 'Past Works of Note' pages have page navigation buttons to click to jump to sections within the page. There is also a 'Return to Top of Page' on the bottom of these pages to jump back to the top of the page.
- Click the 'Return Home' button on any page (besides the home page) to return to the home page where you can navigate to any of the pages.
- Please see any page's corresponding css file (each html file has a css file of the same name) to see styling code.
