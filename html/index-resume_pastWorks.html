    <section id="Competitive_Athletics">
        <div class="competitive_athletics_words">
            <p>I began running cross country as a freshman in high school as a means to get into shape but quickly became very competitive.
                I would end high school as the fastest runner to have ever attended Plano West Senior High School, a 6A school. When I was 17 years old
                I ran my fastest ever 5K time of 15:08. My hard work led to a full ride to UT Arlington, a local division 1 university, to compete. 
                </p>
                <h4>UT Arlington Athletics</h4>
                <p>Collegiate long distance running is a year round sport: Cross country begins in August through November. Indoor Track begins in 
                    December and persists through February. Outdoor Track begins in March and ends at the end of May. June through August is the 
                    only off-season you get and it's required to reset for 10 days and build up your endurance for the long year.</p>
                <p>Four years of divison 1 athletics while trying to keep good grades in an engineering degree, maintain friendships, discover the world, 
                    and have fun left me burnt out. This was a tough ending to a sport I was passionate about and was extremely competitive with. 
                    Despite the rough landing, I achieved times I am ultimately very proud of:</p>

        <p>Orthopedic medical devices are designed to replace the joints of patients that have become deficient and painful. Enovis is a 
            medical techology manufacturer of orthopedic implants and instrumentation. I launched two large scale projects in my four years with Enovis.</p>
        <h4>AltiVate Reverse Glenoid: A 3 Year Saga</h4>
            <p>AltiVate Reverse Glenoid was a 3 year project designed to improve upon the bread-and-butter, original reverse shoulder orthopedic
                implant. Different people have different wear patterns on their shoulder joints and for different wear patterns, different 
                configurations of implants can have better fit and preserve more patient bone.</p>
            <p>The AltiVate Reverse Glenoid (ARG) project came out with 4 new baseplate configurations, 2 new screw sizes, new screw drive features,
                and modernized the instrumentation used to prepare for the original implant as well as introduce new instrumentation to prepare for the
                new implants.</p>
            <p>My specific role was focused on designing and developing the instrumnetation for the implants. This included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Drills</li>
                    <li>Reamers</li>
                    <li>Inserters for various implants</li>
                    <li>Handles</li>

        <h4>SolidWorks</h4>
        <p>SolidWorks is a Computer Aided Design (CAD) software package designed to allow users to model objects in 3D using specific mechanical
            dimensioning. Once an object is modeled, a drawing can then be created to show specific views which highlight dimensions associated
            with the geometry of a model. With these two features, machinists can create the model and hold the specified dimensions to the tight 
            window of tolerance specified on the drawing. </p>

    <section id="Software_Engineering">
        <div class="swe_words">
        <p>My interest in software engineering began a few years ago when I buddy described to me what he did and what his day to day looked like.
            As I began to understand more what software engineering was and what programming languages did, my interest grew. While I always feared
            software engineering and programming as unlearnable and unapproachable, I started to realize with a more definitive structure I could
            learn to become a software engineer. This mindset, along with the growing apathy towards my career in medical devices, led me to 
            <strong>Coding Temple</strong>.</p>
