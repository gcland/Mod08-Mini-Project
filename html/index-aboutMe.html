        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Born on Christmas Eve, 1994 in Plano, TX. I grew up and lived in the same area until I was 18 years old. 
        When I was 5 years old my father bought me my first gaming system: a Nintendo 64. 
        The first time I played Star Fox 64 my 5-year-old brain was blown away.
        I fell in love with technology and video games that day. Around this same time my father taught me how to ride my first bike. 
        I still remember him pushing me to speed, releasing me and the feeling of actually riding the bike without training wheels. 
        Moments later I lost speed and fell to the ground. </p>

        <p>As I got older I started playing desktop games and learned how to use a computer. 
        I also started helping my father plant trees into our local park. These experiences began to shape my life through to this day; 
        a balance of nature, appreciation for our environment, technology, and digital experiences.</p>
